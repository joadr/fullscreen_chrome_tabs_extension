# Fullscreen Chrome Tabs Extension
==================================

This extensions allows the user switch between tabs the same way he would do by not beeing on full screen. The extension imitates the chrome's tabs bar with html, css and javascript.

You can bind the extension to a key once installed by navigating to chrome://extensions, scrolling down the bottom and looking for the link "Configure Commands".  When in full screen mode you can then hit "CTRL-Shift-L", type your URL and hit enter.

This plugin works by simply using javascript to redirect the current window to the URL you type. It doesn't view track your history or your links and there are no analytics trackers attached either.

This extension was started using [Blitz fullscreen chrome extensios](https://github.com/will-hart/blitz_fullscreen_chrome_extension). But was improved and almost completely modified by me Joadr.
